## About

Tech entrepreneur, $40M+ raised building AI products. Founder of [Alana AI](https://alana.ai) — one of Brazil's pioneering conversational AI companies. Currently writing [Ahead by AI Design](https://mjientara.substack.com): long-form essays on AI, cognition, and the future of work.

I write about what I build, break, and learn — from Auth0 migrations completed in under an hour with Claude Code, to productivity systems that replace enterprise bloatware. No marketing fluff. Just tools, frameworks, and honest takes for technical founders.

## Background

Before AI became a buzzword, I was already building it. My path includes strategic planning at McCann and Ogilvy, co-founding startups, and creating Alana AI — shipping conversational AI to enterprise clients across Latin America.

Photographer, mountaineer, motorcyclist. Former digital nomad across multiple countries. These experiences shape how I think about systems, resilience, and building things that matter.
